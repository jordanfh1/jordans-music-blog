  <p className={styles.p}>

  <p  className={styles.p}>
    Chet Baker is synonymous with cool jazz, but his 1959 album <i>Chet</i> often flies under the radar compared to his vocal albums. This record is 
    purely instrumental, featuring Baker’s warm, velvety trumpet sound accompanied by jazz legends like Bill Evans on piano and Paul Chambers on bass. 
    Tracks like “Alone Together” and “How High the Moon” are wonderfully delicate, making this one of the best albums to experience Baker’s subtle, haunting style.
