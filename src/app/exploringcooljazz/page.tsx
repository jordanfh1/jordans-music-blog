<h2 className={styles.h2}>1. The Sound of Sonny by Sonny Rollins (1957)</h2>
  <a className={styles.listenLink} href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7rdwLkz0GnXzoigceU8jwQ?si=rYxs6O12S6WtR9GN7MszDA" target="_blank">Listen here on Spotify!</a>

    While Sonny Rollins is celebrated as one of jazz&#39;s great saxophonists, <i>The Sound of Sonny</i> is a cool jazz album that often gets overlooked. 
    This record stands out for its light touch and flowing, lyrical solos. Rollins&#39;s rendition of “Toot, Toot, Tootsie” is playful and inventive, 
    while his take on “The Last Time I Saw Paris” has a beautiful, breezy feel. This album shows a softer side of Rollins that&#39;s both intimate and engaging.

  <h2 className={styles.h2}>2. Chet by Chet Baker (1959)</h2>

  <p  className={styles.p}>
    Chet Baker is synonymous with cool jazz, but his 1959 album <i>Chet</i> often flies under the radar compared to his vocal albums. This record is 
    purely instrumental, featuring Baker&#39;s warm, velvety trumpet sound accompanied by jazz legends like Bill Evans on piano and Paul Chambers on bass. 
    Tracks like “Alone Together” and “How High the Moon” are wonderfully delicate, making this one of the best albums to experience Baker&#39;s subtle, haunting style.

    Bud Powell is usually associated with bebop, but <i>Jazz Giant</i> showcases his cool jazz side, full of nuanced, reflective compositions. 
    Powell&#39;s renditions of tunes like “I&#39;ll Keep Loving You” and “Strictly Confidential” highlight his gentler touch and sophisticated phrasing. 
    This album captures the cool jazz mood perfectly, showing Powell&#39;s versatility and his mastery of more introspective, melodic jazz piano.

  <p className={styles.p}>
    Gil Evans was a master arranger and composer, and <i>Out of the Cool</i> is a lesser-known record that displays his unique orchestral approach to cool jazz. 
    This album blends elements of jazz with experimental harmonies and textures that evoke a cinematic quality. Tracks like “La Nevada” unfold slowly, 
    revealing layers of sound and color that keep listeners captivated. It&#39;s a must-listen for anyone interested in the more orchestrated side of cool jazz.

  <p className={styles.p}>
    Stan Getz was known for his warm, breathy saxophone tone, and <i>The Artistry of Stan Getz</i> perfectly captures his signature cool jazz sound. 
    This album is full of silky, lyrical solos that are both technically impressive and effortlessly smooth. Pieces like “I Thought About You” and “&#39;Round Midnight”
